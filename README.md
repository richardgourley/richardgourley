### :man_technologist: About Me :

**Hello! I am a Data Analyst and former backend web developer based in Barcelona.**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data preparation, data modeling, data visualization and managing data assets using PowerBI, Python and Pandas.
- ðŸ˜„ I previously worked for many years in backend web development making database driven web applications using mainly Django, and occasionally .NET or PHP.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Apache Spark, Data Engineering, Data Warehouses, Data Bricks, Data Lakes and cloud services.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a data analysis blog and also website to help non-technical people build better database driven applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Contact me regarding any data analyst or database/ Python projects you wish to collaborate on.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a teacher and I still enjoy teaching. I really hope some of my github repos can help others learn some tech skills!
